## Making Mod With Template ===>>>
  idk why need it , but...
  if you really need this template :
      https://docs.reactor.gg/quick_start/install_netsdk_template#install-the-mod-template
 > [!Warning]
> The mod needs [BepInEx](https://builds.bepinex.dev/projects/bepinex_be) and [Reactor](https://github.com/nuclearpowered/reactor) to work properly. While **BepInEx** is used by every mod and shouldn't be a problem, without **Reactor** you can't launch the mod.
